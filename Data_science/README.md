# Mobile Home Park Identification Model

## Description
This project involves developing a machine learning model to identify mobile home parks using geospatial data and image classification techniques. The model is built using TensorFlow and trained on satellite imagery data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter

## Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd parker_swe_project
    ```


3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Open the `parker_data_science.ipynb` notebook and follow the steps.

## Model Performance
- **Model Accuracy**: 60%
